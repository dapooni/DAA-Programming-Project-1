The goal of this program is to test and compare the average running time of different sorting algorithms for an input array that is random and sorted.

In this project, we are tasked with sorting N randomly and generated numbers using several sorting algorithms (Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Mergesort, Quicksort, Heapsort) and analyzing their run time. In addition, this report will be divided into two sections: one for the fundamental implementation of the program that sorts the numbers and another for assessing the performance.
 
Our program includes two tasks. It has two types of values: 
(1) Randomized values and 
(2) Generated values. 

The user has the option of selecting whether he prefers integers made at random or sorted in increasing order. Along with this, the user is asked to enter a value for N (numbers of integers) as input.  To sort N randomly/generated numbers, we use these sorting algorithms (Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Mergesort, Quicksort, Heapsort). When the user enters a value for N, the operating system will function until that randomized or generated value is saved in the file out.txt. Once the user compiles and runs the program, a text file out.txt pops up in your computer's C drive.  When you view the file, you can see the randomized values provided by the machine, as well as the produced values computed by the machine, which are now sorted. While on the terminal, you can just view our menu and the process calculation time of the six sorting algorithms. What's great about this program is that it will assist the user to understand how these sorting algorithms operate and how long they will take to run if the N increases.
